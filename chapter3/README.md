# Chapter 3 - Anatomy of an eBPF Program

Make sure you have installed libbpf and its header files as described in the
main [README file](../README.md).

You should then be able to build the example code as an object file by running
`make` in this directory. See Chapter 3 of the book for instructions on what to
do with this object file.
